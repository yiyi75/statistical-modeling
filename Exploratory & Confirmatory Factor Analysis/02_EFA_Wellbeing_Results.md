# EFA Wellbeing Results Interpretation

## Factor Structure Overview
A two-factor solution was selected as optimal, explaining **57% of the total variance** (29% Factor 1 + 28% Factor 2).

## Factor 1 (MR1): Positive Well-being and Life Satisfaction
- **Strong loadings**: LifeSatisfaction1 (0.81), LifeSatisfaction2 (0.80), LifeSatisfaction3 (0.89)
- **Moderate loadings**: Happy (0.64), Cheerful (0.60)
- **Interpretation**: This factor combines cognitive evaluations of life satisfaction with positive affective experiences, suggesting these dimensions are closely related in this sample. All items show clean loadings with no cross-loadings on negative affect.

## Factor 2 (MR2): Negative Affect
- **Strong loadings**: Anxious (0.79), Irritated (0.69), Depressed (0.67), Angry (0.66), Sad (0.65)
- **Moderate loading**: Worried (0.54) - note cross-loading on Factor 1 (0.32)
- **Interpretation**: This represents general negative emotional experience, capturing six distinct but correlated negative affective states. Anxiety shows the highest loading, which may reflect its salience in this academic context.

## Key Findings
- **Total variance explained**: 57% (improved from 47% in 1-factor model)
- **Factor correlation**: 0.63 - indicates a moderate-to-strong relationship between positive and negative well-being dimensions
- **Item performance**: All items load >0.52, with good item discrimination
- **Cross-loading note**: 'Worried' shows meaningful cross-loading (0.32 on Factor 1, 0.54 on Factor 2), suggesting it may relate to both dimensions

## Model Fit Comparison
| Model  | Factors | Variance Explained | RMSEA (90% CI)       | BIC      | χ² p-value      |
|--------|---------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1-factor | 1       | 47%               | .182 (.164-.201)     | 90.98    | < 5.7e-44      |
| 2-factor | 2       | 57%               | .148 (.127-.171)     | -1.71    | < 3.2e-21      |
| 3-factor | 3       | 62%               | .137 (.113-.163)     | -16.47   | < 1.8e-13      |

## Factor Composition Summary
**Factor 1 (Positive Well-being)**: LifeSatisfaction1, LifeSatisfaction2, LifeSatisfaction3, Happy, Cheerful  
**Factor 2 (Negative Affect)**: Angry, Sad, Anxious, Depressed, Worried, Irritated

## Why 2 Factors Were Selected
1. **Statistical improvement**: Significant χ² difference between 1 and 2 factors (p<.001), with RMSEA improving from .182 to .148
2. **Theoretical coherence**: Clear positive well-being vs. negative affect structure aligns with established well-being models
3. **Interpretability**: 2-factor solution provides clean, interpretable factors without the complexity of the 3-factor model
4. **Empirical support**: Parallel analysis using principal components suggested 2 components
5. **Parsimony**: The 2-factor model balances explained variance (57%) with model simplicity

## Limitations and Considerations
- The moderate factor correlation (0.63) suggests these dimensions share substantial variance while remaining distinct
- The Worried item's cross-loading indicates it may tap into both affective dimensions or represent a unique aspect
- The explained variance (57%) suggests additional factors may influence well-being not captured here
- Sample characteristics (students) may influence the factor structure observed
