# EFA Wellbeing Results Interpretation

## Factor 1 (MR1): Life Satisfaction/Happiness Factor
    Strong loadings: LifeSatisfaction1 (0.787), LifeSatisfaction2 (0.828), LifeSatisfaction3 (0.881)

    Moderate loading: Happy (0.545)

    Interpretation: This represents cognitive well-being and positive affect. The three life satisfaction items (SWLS items) form the core, with happiness loading moderately as well. This factor explains 27.6% of the variance.

## Factor 2 (MR2): Negative Affect Factor
    Strong loadings: Angry (0.725), Sad (0.706), Anxious (0.628), Depressed (0.727), Worried (0.622)

    Interpretation: This represents general negative affect/distress. All negative emotion items load cleanly on this factor with no cross-loadings. This factor explains 27.0% of the variance.

## Key Findings
    Total variance explained: 54.5% (adequate for psychological measures)

    All items load >0.54: Excellent item discrimination with no weak loadings

    Factor correlation: 0.62 - indicates a moderate relationship between positive and negative well-being dimensions

## Model Fit Comparison
    Model	Factors	    Variance Explained	    RMSEA	    BIC	            χ² p-value
    1-factor	1	        47%	                .188	    68.41	        < 2.8e-30
    2-factor	2	        57%	                .125	    -23.92	        9.5e-09
    3-factor	3	        65%	                .009	    -50.79	        0.43

## Why 2 Factors?
    Statistical: Significant improvement in RMSEA from 1 to 2 factors (0.188 -> 0.125)

    Parsimony: 2 factors are simpler than 3

    Theoretical: Clear positive vs. negative affect structure

    Empirical: All items have strong, clean loadings

    Methodological: Supported by Horn's parallel analysis
