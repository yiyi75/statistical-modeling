It is important to maintain a balance between rational thinking skills and handling certain situations so that it protects one's wellbeing. ","Through the practices that were completed, stress has definitely adopted a more positive definition in my perspective. Essentially, stress is a leading factor of poor performance and tendencies of anxiety, but if coped with in a healthy manner, it is a significant performance booster. If one perceives stress as a motivator instead of a competitor or weakness, it helps to reduce how overwhelming certain worrisome situations can be. It can act as a barrier between an individual and the feeling of defeated at the hand of responsibilities and worrisome events.","The training has made a noticeable effect on my life.

118,"My wellbeing has changed quite a bit since the beginning of this study partly because when I first started this study, I was just beginning university and so I was very nervous and anxious as to what I should expect. The last week had been challenging, I spent many nights up at night pondering about my day and thinking of all the work I had yet to complete. This study gave me an opportunity to step back, take 10 minutes of my day to reflect on my mental wellbeing and remove myself from the chaos around me. Each day as I was picking the options best describing my mood, I began noticing how much stress I was unnecessarily putting myself through and it made me realize that the way I think about situations has a huge impact on whether my day is good or bad. This allowed me to re-evaluate myself and understand that it isn't worth stressing about school or assignments if it takes such a toll on myself. This study helped me realize that my wellbeing was valuable in a sense, that it was more than just a number of agreement or disagreement on a page and that I had to start making serious changes to enjoy life more. As I have taken upon a more positive outlook on life and the situations I find myself in, my wellbeing has made a change for the better.","Wellbeing is the state of being well, being healthy both physically and mentally.
