# Statistical Modeling
This repository contains reproducible implementations of common and advanced  statistical models used in data science and research.

## Motivation
I created this project to bridge rigorous statistical methodology 
(e.g., SEM, multilevel models) with applied data science use cases 
(e.g., churn prediction, behavioral outcomes).

## Topics Covered
- Linear & Multiple Regression
- Generalized Linear Models
- Multilevel / Hierarchical Models
- Exploratory & Confirmatory Factor Analysis
- Structural Equation Modeling
- Mediation & Path Analysis

## Structure
Each model folder includes:
- Problem formulation
- Statistical assumptions
- R implementation
- Diagnostics & interpretation
- Extensions
