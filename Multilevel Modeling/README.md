## Overview
This repository presents a reproducible case study applying **multilevel (mixed-effects) modeling** to longitudinal intervention data collected via an AI-based chatbot.

The study evaluates how different **mindfulness intervention designs** influence daily psychological outcomes, with repeated observations nested within individuals. The analysis emphasizes **growth modeling, condition × time interactions, and mechanism-level outcomes**.

## Research Questions
- How do mindfulness interventions affect **within-person change** in daily well-being over time?
- Do different intervention designs (Choice vs. Value vs. Control) produce **differential growth trajectories**?
- Which outcomes show **intervention-specific effects** versus general time trends?
- How much variance in outcomes is attributable to **within-person vs. between-person** differences?

## Why This Project
This repository is intended as a portfolio-ready example of applied longitudinal modeling, demonstrating:

- Proper handling of nested data structures
- Distinction between time effects and intervention effects
- Conservative interpretation of null and significant findings
- Translation of statistical results into substantive conclusions
